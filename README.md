**EZTip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **John Paul Minimo**

Time spent: **23** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Dark Mode
- [x] Split Bill Calculator (Split the bill between multiple people)

## Notes

Needed to learn Xcode and its layout, and how storyboard connects and is implemented with swift.
Had to get used to swift syntax and quirks coming from mostly writing programs in java.
Needed to figure out why total was not updating on the fly. Implemented a method which tracks change, and then calls updateBill method
